## Additional Information

Much of the website has now been redesigned for 2021, however a lot of vital information is still missing like:

- Links to FOSSASIA videos for the 7 conducted workshops
- First two events do not have any relevant explanation/content yet
- All but the Competition Series Activity do not have any content

Note: This should be considered an update to the User Element of the website, however much of the content is still incomplete and requires further updates from others.
