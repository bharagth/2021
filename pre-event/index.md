## BuildingBloCS Competition Series

Similar to last year, there will be a special competition series to promote awareness and appreciation of how Computing is connected to our daily lives and the world around us, starting with the appreciation of culture. It will be a secular competition with the objective of connecting festivities to Computing.

## Coursemology **NOTE TO SELF MAY CHANGE**
Challenge yourself with Project Euler questions and hone your Python programming skills and mathematical knowledge. You will learn how to create different kinds of visualizations for different kinds of data and also make use of cool data science tools to start your own analyses. Join our BBCS Coursemology and start your journey!

## Entertainment

Afraid you'll be bored by pure coding lingo and activities? (Though our activities are definitely not boring but) Fret not! We'll be having fun stuff along the way to liven up your experience! Look out for coding jokes, fun games and videos, and even mini competitions! Life is fun!

_An example to get you going: A guy walks into a bar and asks for 1.4 root beers.
The bartender says "I'll have to charge you extra, that's a root beer float"_

## DataCamp Outreach Workshop

Data science and artificial intelligence have become hot topics ubiquitous in almost all industries such as business, education, healthcare, security, etc. The list never ends!

Held on the 15th April 2020, participants had the opportunity to learn about these topics through DataCamp.

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is a platform that allows you to learn about data science, machine learning, etc. It comes in courses conducted by industry experts with bite-size exercises accompanied by clear instructional videos. Users can learn data analytics and machine learning from the comfort of their browser, at their own pace, and tailored to their needs and expertise, and even earn industry certification!

## Lightning Labs

2020 is an exciting year and BuildingBloCS 2020 is trying out a new format of learning. This year, we have a new segment call Lightning Labs (previously called Lightning Workshops), it is a segment where YOU (and your friends) can:

1. Showcase your projects (computing related ofc, but doesnt need to be finished products, products in development or prototypes would work too)
2. Conduct a workshop (it can be about anything related to tech!!! eg: competitive programming, socket programming, image manipulation, video effects, etc!!)
3. Views/opinions on the computing community in the form of interactive debates on issues such as: "is javascript too flexible such that it becomes too hard to learn?"
4. Come up with your own computing/tech related short lab!!!

**NOTE: MAX PER TEAM: 3 PERSON**
