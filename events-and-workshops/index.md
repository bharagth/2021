## BBCS X Entertainment

Afraid you'll be bored by pure coding lingo and activities? (Though our activities are definitely not boring but) Fret not! We'll be having fun stuff along the way to liven up your experience! Look out for coding jokes, fun games and videos, and even mini competitions! Life is fun!

_An example to get you going:<br>
A guy walks into a bar and asks for 1.4 root beers. The bartender says "I'll have to charge you extra, that's a root beer float"_
